# 🌞 **3D Interstellar Space System with Rapier Physics & Three.js** 🌍

Welcome to the **3D Solar System** where the cosmos meets code, and physics comes to life! 🚀✨ This project is a cosmic journey powered by **Three.js** for rendering the universe, and **Rapier Physics** to simulate the laws of gravity that govern it all.

## 🚀 What’s in the Stars?

- 🌟 **Planets**: Realistic planets revolving around a dynamic **Sun**.
- 🌌 **Gravity**: Real-time gravitational simulation, thanks to **Rapier Physics**.
- 🌠 **Interactivity**: Click to focus on celestial bodies, with smooth camera movement.
- 🔊 **Background Music**: Immerse yourself in space vibes with looping background audio! (No spacesuit required).

## 🌑 Tech Stack

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering engine to create stunning visuals of planets, stars, and space!
- **Rapier Physics**: For physics-based simulation, handling gravity and collisions between celestial bodies.
- **React**: For smooth interactivity and seamless component management.
- **GLSL Shaders**: To give the Sun that fiery, explosive look 🔥.
- **CSS**: For styling, keeping things neat and cosmic.

## 🌠 Features

- **Custom Shaders**: Watch the Sun's glowing surface come to life with noise-based shader effects!
- **Space Realism**: Realistic orbital mechanics and gravity simulation between the Sun, planets, and moons.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: ZOOM in and Zoom out on any object to focus on it with smooth camera transitions!
- **Astro Music**: Feel the vibe of the universe with soothing ambient sounds that loop forever!

## 🚀 How to Launch Your Own Solar System

Ready to launch into the stars? 🌠 Follow the steps below to clone and run your very own cosmic system:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

### 2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run Locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000` and watch the planets dance!

## 🔧 Features to Explore

- **Planetary Orbits**: Each planet has a unique orbit, and the gravity from the Sun keeps them in line.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Pinch to zoom or scroll to get a closer look at your favorite planet!
- **Smooth Camera Movements**: With a single click, travel from one planet to another or simply admire the entire solar system from afar.

## 🌟 TODO (The Universe is Expanding!)

- 🚀 **Moons & Satellites**: Add orbiting moons for the planets! Maybe a ring system for Saturn? (Why not, right?)
- 🌌 **Asteroids**: Add some chaos to space with a random asteroid field.
- 🚀 **More Shaders**: Make the planets even more dynamic with cooler shaders and effects.

## 👨‍🚀 Credits

- **Three.js** – For the mind-blowing 3D rendering engine.
- **Rapier Physics** – For simulating gravity that keeps everything in its place.
- **GLSL** – For crafting the shaders that give the Sun its glowing, fiery look.
- **You** – For making this space journey fun! 🌟

### 🌌 Let’s keep exploring! 🌟

Now that you're ready to travel through space, enjoy your **3D Solar System** and experience the magic of the cosmos, powered by Three.js and Rapier Physics. Don’t forget to keep your space helmet on, and **don’t forget to save the planets!** 🚀
